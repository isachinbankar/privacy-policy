### 3. User Choice & Opt-Out
You can opt-out of personalized advertising or reset your advertising identifier at any time through your device settings:
* **Android Settings > Google > Ads > Reset/Delete Advertising ID**.

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion
Your game progress (levels, high scores) is stored locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to our servers. To delete this data, you can clear the app's cache/storage in your device settings or uninstall the app.
